My first thought was making it a [Beerware License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware) 

But that is not an officially registered license. So I went with the [Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/)  
Which basically says you can do anything you want with what I created. But you can't sue me.

🍺🍺🍺 ... you can still buy me a beer though  
If you are flying from the US to Amsterdam, bring me anything from the [Heretic Brewing Company](http://hereticbrewing.com/beers)

Cheers!
